## Capturing

## Controlling vehicles

## Controller tokens

The advantages of using controller tokens are:

* A single controller token may be associated with multiple vehicles. This allows several vehicles to be controlled at once with a single input.
* The controller token need not be placed within the vehicle itself. This allows a vehicle to be controlled remotely, even from another scene.
* By granting players control of the controller token, they can be used to give your players control of a vehicle.
