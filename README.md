# Vehicles module for Foundry VTT

## Installation

You can install this module by searching for it in Foundry's built-in module browser, or with the following public URL:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grandseiken/foundryvtt-vehicles/master/module.json
```

This module depends on the [Multilevel Tokens](https://github.com/grandseiken/foundryvtt-multilevel-tokens) module. Please make sure you have the latest version of both modules installed, or you might run into problems!

Remember to enable the module in the **Manage Modules** menu after installation.

## Capturing

## Controlling vehicles

## Controller tokens

The advantages of using controller tokens are:

* By granting players control of the controller token, they can be used to give your players control of a vehicle.
* A single controller token may be associated with multiple vehicles. This allows several vehicles to be controlled at once with a single input.
* The controller token need not be placed within the vehicle itself. This allows a vehicle to be controlled remotely, even from another scene.
* A vehicle's movement may cause a controller token to move, causing another vehicle to also move, and so on. I am sure somebody will find a way to devise elaborate contraptions.
